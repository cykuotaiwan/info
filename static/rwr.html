            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                RWR is a radar detecting system that can extract several
                features within radar signals thus identifying certain radar
                emitters. This is the first highly self-design system of my
                previous company. My role in this project was to design a
                classifying algorithm and the entire software structure.
                Moreover, I was the project coordinator and owner, my
                responsibility was to coordinate among colleagues and clients,
                and onsite tech support and integration.

            <p>
                Radar signal is pulsed radio frequency (RF) signal. Therefore,
                after radar signal is collected by receiver antenna and fed into
                receiver module, pulse characteristics and RF characteristics
                are extracted. FPGA module then processes these characteristics
                and produces pulse descriptive words (PDWs) that represent radar
                signals. Computing module analysis PDWs, extract features of the
                radar signal, format the information into emitter report, and
                pass the report to the monitor module. Finally, the operator
                then identifies the emitters by observing the report shown on
                the monitor.

            <img
                src="/assets/img/rwr_software_sketch.svg"
                alt="software sketch"
            />
            <p>
                As previously stated, the radar signal is converted into PDWs by
                FPGA module and passed to the computing module for further
                analysis. All PDWs are assumed that originate from multiple
                radar emitter sources before being processed by the computing
                module. The Signal isolator is implemented with real-time
                clustering method to isolate a single emitter source. The
                feature extractor then extracts several features, such as PRI
                type, RF jump type, and scan type, from each isolated PDWs.
                Finally, all features are combined into an emitter report by the
                report formatter and sent to the client’s monitor module.
