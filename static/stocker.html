            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                Stocker is a web service that automatically collects, updates,
                and screens financial statements of all listed and OTC stocks in
                the Taiwan stock market. My friend Raymond and I started this
                project from scratch in 2019 to save our time from processing
                thousands of financial statements every quarter. Since we are
                both amateur investors and professional engineers, we decide to
                design our system to automate the routine process.

            <p>
                Stocker is separated into three sub-projects: crawler, server,
                and frontend. Stocker server is based on Python Flask and
                SQLAlchemy. It handles all RESTful APIs and ORM with MySQL.
                Crawler is based on Python and the BueatifulSoup module. It
                collects financial statements from Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE)
                and news from media websites. The frontend service is still in
                beta version which currently uses React as its framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                We deploy these services on an AWS instance. With crontab, a
                daily routine in the crawler would be triggered periodically and
                pass the data to the server with the private channel. Once the
                server receives data, it would update the data into several
                databases, filter recent data with private criteria, and
                finally, push recommendations or notifications to messengers
                such as Line and Telegram.
            </p>
            <p>
                We used to spend at least 5 hours each day for a whole week
                during the earning season only to screen the report of thousands
                of companies. With the help of the stocker, the earning season
                routine has significantly shrunk to 3 hours. Furthermore, since
                we have all data, we can build any model at our will.
